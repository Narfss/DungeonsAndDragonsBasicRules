                    </div>
                    <p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the
                        towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p>
                    <table class="bg-white">
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM):</strong> After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach.
                                    They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of
                                    the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green
                                    with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.</p>
                                <p><strong>Phillip (playing Gareth):</strong> I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.</p>
                                <p><strong>Amy (playing Riva):</strong> The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can
                        scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p>
                    <table class="bg-white">
                        <tr>

                                <p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM): </strong>OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles?</p>
                                <p><strong>Phillip: </strong>Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?</p>
                                <p><strong>DM:</strong> Make an Intelligence check.</p>
                                <p><strong>Phillip: </strong>Does my Investigation skill apply?</p>
                                <p><strong>DM: </strong>Sure!</p>
                                <p><strong>Phillip (rolling a d20): </strong>Ugh. Seven.</p>
                                <p><strong>DM: </strong>They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?</p>
                            </td>

                    <p>In the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted
                        castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other
                        treasure.</p>
                    <p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe
                        the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone
                        will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything
                        the players attempt, D&amp;D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p>
                    <p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends
                        every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story,
                        but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.</p>
                    <p>There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes
                        an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose
                        to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.</p>

                            <p>The many worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic
                                that make these worlds unique.</p>
                            <p>The worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and
                                the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&amp;D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk,
                                Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&amp;D players for their own games. And amid
                                all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.</p>
                            <p>All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits
                                in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged,
                                soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&amp;D worlds,
                                and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.</p>
                            <p>Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&amp;D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your
                                play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.</p>

                            <p>The D&amp;D Basic Rules document is divided into three parts.</p>
                            <p><b>Part 1</b> is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other
                                customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.</p>
                            <p><b>Part 2</b> details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts,
                                and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.</p>
                            <p><b>Part 3</b> is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&amp;D, the rules for spellcasting, and a selection of typical spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>

                            <p>The play of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>
                            <p><b>1. The DM describes the environment.</b> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s
                                on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).</p>
                            <p><b>2. The players describe what they want to do.</b> Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might
                                search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve
                                those actions.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide
                                a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>
                            <p><b>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.</b> Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p>
                            <p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured
                                and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>
                            <p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood,
                                and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent
                                each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>
                            <h5 id="game-dice">Game Dice</h5>
                            <p>The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.</p>
                            <p>In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: <strong class="roll-dice">d4</strong>, <strong class="roll-dice">d6</strong>, <strong class="roll-dice">d8</strong>, <strong class="roll-dice">d10</strong>, <strong class="roll-dice">d12</strong>, and <strong class="roll-dice">d20</strong>. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).
                            </p>
                            <p>Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other
                                gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit
                                from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>
                            <p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, “<strong class="roll-dice">3d8 + 5</strong>” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>
                            <p>The same d notation appears in the expressions “<strong class="roll-dice">1d3</strong>” and “<strong class="roll-dice">1d2</strong>.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a <strong class="roll-dice">d6</strong> and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of <strong class="roll-dice">1d2</strong>, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll
                                depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it’s a 2.)</p>
                            <h5 id="the-d20">The D20</h5>
                            <p>Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,
                                or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>
                            <p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six <b>ability scores</b>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for
                                most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the <b>ability modifiers</b> derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s
                                or monster’s behalf.</p>
                            <p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>
                            <p><b>1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</b> Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s
                                particular skill. (See <a href="#howtoplayparent_911">chapter 1</a> for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)</p>
                            <p><b>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</b> A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>
                            <p><b>3. Compare the total to a target number.</b> If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The <b>DM</b> is usually the one who
                                determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>
                            <p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <b>Difficulty Class</b> (<span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>). The target number for an attack roll is called an <b>Armor Class</b> (<span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span>).</p>
                            <p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">Chapter 7</a> provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>
                            <h5 id="basic-advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h5>
                            <p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects
                                the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example,
                                if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
                            <p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">chapter 7</a>.</p>
                            <h5 id="specific-beats-general">Specific Beats General</h5>
                            <p>This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in
                                some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p>
                            <p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples
                                of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>
                            <h5 id="round-down">Round Down</h5>
                            <p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>

                            <p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores
                                and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each
                                other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p>
                            <p>The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and desires.
                                In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created
                                and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a
                                villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.</p>
                            <p>Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill
                                or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle,
                                find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to do next.</p>
                            <p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions,
                                and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy
                                the spoils of their labors.</p>
                            <p>But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent
                                group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p>
                            <h5 id="the-three-pillars-of-adventure">The Three Pillars of Adventure</h5>
                            <p>Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>
                            <p><b>Exploration</b> includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they
                                want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through
                                caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</p>
                            <p><b>Social interaction</b> features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,
                                pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.</p>
                            <p>The rules in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">chapter 7</a> and <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a> support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1001">chapter 4</a>.</p>
                            <p><b>Combat</b>, the focus of <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every
                                enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle,
                                there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other
                                creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</p>
                            <h5 id="the-wonders-of-magic">The Wonders of Magic</h5>
                            <p>Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10 and 11.</p>
                            <p>In the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually minor—a
                                fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p>
                            <p>For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors
                                might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.</p>
                            <p>Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a
                                hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just
                                a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a
                        race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your
                        avatar in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world.</p>
                    <p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional
                        character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you
                        want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches your interest.</p>
                    <p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the
                        table with a character you’re excited to play.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this chapter, we use the term <b>character sheet</b> to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece
                        of notebook paper. An official D&amp;D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.</p>

                            <p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have
                                <b>subraces</b>, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. <a href="#howtoplayparent_951">Chapter 2</a> provides more information about these races.</p>
                            <p>The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial
                                traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes
                                (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain
                                dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p>
                            <p>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p>

                            <p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,
                                or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.</p>
                            <p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are <b>class features</b>—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You
                                also gain a number of <b>proficiencies</b>: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to

                                level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.</p>
                            <p>Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0
                                XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).</p>
                            <h6 id="hit-points-and-hit-dice">Hit Points and Hit Dice</h6>
                            <p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>
                            <p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution
                                modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your <b>hit point maximum</b>.</p>
                            <p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting”
                                in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a>).</p>
                            <h6 id="class-proficiency-bonus">Proficiency Bonus</h6>
                            <p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</li>
                                <li>Attack rolls with spells you cast</li>
                                <li>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</li>
                                <li>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</li>
                                <li>Saving throws you’re proficient in</li>
                                <li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">chapter 7</a>, tools in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>.) Your background gives you additional
                                skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p>
                            <p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests
                                that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</p>
                            <h6>Building Bruenor, Step 2</h6>
                            <p>Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.</p>
                            <p>As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10—and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see
                                step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.</p>

                            <p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: <b>Strength</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>, <b>Constitution</b>, <b>Intelligence</b>, <b>Wisdom</b>, and <b>Charisma</b>. Each ability has a score, which
                                is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
                            <p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">chapter 7</a>. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what
                                classes consider each ability particularly important.</p>
                            <p>You generate your character’s six <b>ability scores</b> randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If
                                you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>
                            <p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability
                                scores as a result of your race choice.</p>
                            <p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your <b>ability modifiers</b> using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and
                                then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>

                                <p>Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting
                                    spells.</p>

                            <p>Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a
                                brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his
                                Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (–1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1).</p>
                            <p>Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.</p>
                            <h6 id="customizing-ability-scores">Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</h6>
                            <p>At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.</p>
                            <p>You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can
                                end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.</p>
                            <p>This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any
                                set of numbers between those extremes.</p>

                            <p>Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general
                                terms.</p>
                            <p>Using the information in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1001">chapter 4</a>, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s <b>alignment</b> (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and <b>ideals</b>.
                                <a href="#howtoplayparent_1001">Chapter 4</a> also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called <b>bonds</b>, and the <b>flaws</b> that could one day undermine him or her.</p>
                            <p>Your character’s <b>background</b> describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in the D&amp;D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in
                                <a href="#howtoplayparent_1001">chapter 4</a>, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.</p>
                            <p>A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information,
                                along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.</p>
                            <h6 id="your-characters-abilities">Your Character’s Abilities</h6>
                            <p>Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character
                                with low Strength.</p>
                            <p>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.</p>
                            <p>A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.</p>
                            <p>A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.</p>
                            <p>A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.</p>
                            <p>A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.</p>
                            <p>A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.</p>
                            <h6>Building Bruenor, Step 4</h6>
                            <p>Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests
                                a degree of forgetfulness.</p>
                            <p>Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to
                                reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.</p>
                            <p>Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends
                                and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.</p>
                            <p>Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot
                                for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.</p>

                            <p>Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of <b>gold pieces</b> (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>. Extensive lists
                                of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the Trinkets table at the end of <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>).</p>
                            <p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">Chapter 7</a> has more information on carrying capacity.

Things that contribute to your <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters
                                wear armor or carry shields, however.</p>
                            <p>Without armor or a shield, your character’s <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> using the rules in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>. Record your <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> on your character
                                sheet.</p>
                            <p>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield
                                if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>.</p>
                            <p>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span>. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span>, you choose which one to use.</p>
                            <h6 id="weapons-intro">Weapons</h6>
                            <p>For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.</p>
                            <p>When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For attacks with <b>melee weapons</b>, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.</li>
                                <li>For attacks with <b>ranged weapons</b>, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6>Building Bruenor, Step 5</h6>
                            <p>Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.</p>
                            <p>For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency
                                bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the
                                same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it hits.</p>

                            <p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1
                                each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p>

                            <p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to

                        </h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>A visit to one of the great cities in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons—Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors—overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells
                        of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>And the people themselves—people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues—represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling
                        among a variety of human ethnicities.</p>
                    <p>Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes
                        laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of
                        the sunlight, is a lone drow—a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind. The <i>Player’s Handbook</i> has more information about these unusual races.</p>
                    <h4 id="choosing-a-race">Choosing a Race</h4>
                    <p>Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&amp;D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.</p>
                    <p>Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Other races
                        and subraces are less common as adventurers.</p>
                    <p>Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you
                        want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.</p>
                    <p>Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that
                        race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their
                        race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.</p>
                    <h5 id="racial-traits">Racial Traits</h5>
                    <p>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.</p>
                    <h6>Ability Score Increase</h6>
                    <p>Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.</p>
                    <h6>Age</h6>
                    <p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age
                        for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced
                        age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p>
                    <h6>Alignment</h6>
                    <p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better
                        define your character.</p>
                    <h6>Size</h6>
                    <p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently.
                        The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>.</p>
                    <h6>Speed</h6>
                    <p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (<a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a>) and fighting (<a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>).</p>
                    <h6>Languages</h6>
                    <p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. <a href="#howtoplayparent_1001">Chapter 4</a> lists the most common languages of the D&amp;D multiverse.</p>
                    <h6>Subraces</h6>
                    <p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. In the Dragonlance
                        campaign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield dwarves and
                        gold dwarves, respectively.</p>

                                    the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out an’ looked for ye!”</p>

                            <p>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these
                                common threads unite all dwarves.</p>
                            <h5 id="short-and-stout">Short and Stout</h5>
                            <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly
                                two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p>
                            <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or
                                brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>
                            <h5 id="long-memory-long-grudges">Long Memory, Long Grudges</h5>
                            <p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can
                                recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such
                                as humans and halflings lack.</p>
                            <p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding
                                of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor,
                                skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p>
                            <p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered.
                                A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>
                            <h5 id="clans-and-kingdoms">Clans and Kingdoms</h5>
                            <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this
                                love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes.
                                Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>
                            <p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke
                                their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>
                            <p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>
                            <h5 id="gods-gold-and-clan">Gods, Gold, and Clan</h5>
                            <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration
                                of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan
                                suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p>

                                <p>Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it
                                    can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.</p>
                                <p><b><i>Elves.</i></b> “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous.
                                    Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not
                                    as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.”</p>
                                <p><b><i>Halflings.</i></b> “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?”</p>
                                <p><b><i>Humans.</i></b> “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s
                                    when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets
                                    them in trouble more often than not.”</p>

                            <p><dfn>Age.</dfn> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Alignment.</dfn> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the
                                benefits of a just order.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Size.</dfn> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Speed.</dfn> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Darkvision.</dfn> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
                                You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Dwarven Resilience.</dfn> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>).</p>

                            <p><dfn>Languages.</dfn> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.</p>

                            <p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerûn in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Dragonlance
                                setting.</p>

                            <p>As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerûn, as well
                                as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.</p>

                            <p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where
                                soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>

                            <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6
                                feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>
                            <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and

                            <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They
                                tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends
                                and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>
                            <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into

                                They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no

                            <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>

                                <h6>Haughty but Gracious</h6>
                                <p>Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high expectations—which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.</p>
                                <p>Dwarves. “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.”</p>
                                <p>Halflings. “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the
                                    need arises.”</p>
                                <p>Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to appreciate
                                    their achievements. If only they could slow down and learn some refinement.”</p>

                            <h5 id="exploration-and-adventure">Exploration and Adventure</h5>
                            <p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing
                                over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might
                                join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>
                            <h5 id="elf-names">Elf Names</h5>
                            <p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p>
                            <p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of
                                respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination
                                of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>

                            <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ability Score Increase.</dfn> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Age.</dfn> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and
                                an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Alignment.</dfn> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than
                                not.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Size.</dfn> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Speed.</dfn> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Darkvision.</dfn> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it
                                were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Keen Senses.</dfn> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Fey Ancestry.</dfn> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Trance.</dfn> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
                                dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
                            </p>
                            <p><dfn>Languages.</dfn> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races.
                                Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Subrace.</dfn> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. This document presents two of these subraces to choose from.
                                In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>
                            <h6 id="high-elf">High Elf</h6>
                            <p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the
                                Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk,
                                the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.
                            </p>
                            <p>The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are
                                much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with
                                gold.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ability Score Increase.</dfn> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Elf Weapon Training.</dfn> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Cantrip.</dfn> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Extra Language.</dfn> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>
                            <h6 id="wood-elf">Wood Elf</h6>
                            <p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance,
                                as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.</p>
                            <p>Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ability Score Increase.</dfn> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Elf Weapon Training.</dfn> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Fleet of Foot.</dfn> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Mask of the Wild.</dfn> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>

                                <p>Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be universally reviled. Their depraved society is preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire
                                    families as noble houses vie for position. Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are worthless except as slaves.</p>
                                <p>Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do’Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent.</p>

                                    of his diminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportunities presented themselves.
                                    The crooked stick that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon.</p>

                            <p>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though
                                some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But
                                even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.</p>
                            <h5 id="small-and-practical">Small and Practical</h5>
                            <p>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries
                                in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.</p>
                            <p>Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and
                                mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.</p>
                            <p>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather
                                than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p>

                            <p>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into
                                the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.</p>
                            <p>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</p>
                            <h5 id="blend-into-the-crowd">Blend into the Crowd</h5>
                            <p>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.</p>
                            <p>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.</p>
                            <h5 id="pastoral-pleasantries">Pastoral Pleasantries</h5>
                            <p>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort of
                                halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p>
                            <p>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from
                                place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p>

                            <p>Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.</p>

                            <p>Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.</p>

                            <p>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that
                                they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and
                                trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p>
                            <h5 id="a-broad-spectrum">A Broad Spectrum</h5>
                            <p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250
                                pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman
                                blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</p>
                            <h5 id="variety-in-all-things">Variety in All Things</h5>
                            <p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they
                                build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far
                                beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group,
                                humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</p>

                            <p>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on
                                the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath
                                or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.</p>
                            <p>Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</p>

                            <p>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion
                                causes rather than territories or groups.</p>

                                <p>Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members of other races. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants,
                                    and functionaries of all kinds.</p>

                            <p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but
                                most parents give names that are linked to their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.</p>
                            <p>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern
                                lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest
                                humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.</p>
                            <p>In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerûn. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration
                                no matter which world your human is in.</p>

                    <p>Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women
                        and men can’t stand against.</p>
                    <p>Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people
                        and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing
                        servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.</p>
                    <p>Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more
                        and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.</p>
                    <p>Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and dabble in the cleric class while continuing to advance as a rogue. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and
                        advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, can be found in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>.</p>
                    <p>Four basic classes—listed in the Classes table—are found in almost every D&amp;D world and define most typical adventurers. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for information about other classes.</p>

                            <p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p>
                            <p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe’s fall.</p>
                            <p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p>
                            <p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with
                                divine magic.</p>
                            <h5 id="healers-and-warriors">Healers and Warriors</h5>
                            <p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks
                                it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p>
                            <p>Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.
                            </p>
                            <p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume
                                their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.
                            </p>
                            <h5 id="divine-agents">Divine Agents</h5>
                            <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In
                                some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p>
                            <p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics
                                in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince
                                to enter the world.</p>
                            <p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p>
                            <h5 id="creating-a-cleric">Creating a Cleric</h5>
                            <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. The <i>Player’s Handbook</i> includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse.
                                Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.</p>
                            <p>Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests
                                of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?</p>
                            <h6>Quick Build</h6>
                            <p>You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.</p>

                            <h5 id="cleric-spellcasting">Spellcasting</h5>
                            <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See <a href="#howtoplayparent_1206">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of <a href="#cleric-spells">cleric spells</a>.</p>
                            <h6>Cantrips</h6>
                            <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Preparing and Casting Spells</h6>
                            <p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
                                you finish a long rest.</p>
                            <p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one
                                spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
                                the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                            <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                            <h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6>
                            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
                                use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                            <p class="formula"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                            <p class="formula"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                            <h6>Ritual Casting</h6>
                            <p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
                            <h6>Spellcasting Focus</h6>
                            <p>You can use a holy symbol (found in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>
                            <h5 id="divine-domain">Divine Domain</h5>
                            <p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>                                for details on all the domains.</p>
                            <p>Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th,
                                and 17th levels.</p>
                            <h6>Domain Spells</h6>
                            <p>Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells
                                you can prepare each day.</p>
                            <p>If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>
                            <h5 id="channel-divinity">Channel Divinity</h5>
                            <p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains
                                grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>
                            <p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
                            <p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> equals your cleric spell save <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>.</p>
                            <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>
                            <h6 id="turn-undead">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h6>
                            <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned
                                for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>
                            <p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
                                or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
                            <h5 id="cleric-ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h5>
                            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
                                score above 20 using this feature.</p>

                            <h5 id="divine-intervention">Divine Intervention</h5>
                            <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>
                            <p>Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the
                                nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>
                            <p>If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>
                            <p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>
                            <h4 id="divine-domains">Divine Domains</h4>
                            <p>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio
                                of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.</p>
                            <p>Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different
                                place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.</p>
                            <p>Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as from the Celtic,
                                Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.</p>

                            <p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those
                                in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander,
                                Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).</p>
                            <h6>Bonus Proficiency</h6>
                            <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>
                            <h6 id="disciple-of-life">Disciple of Life</h6>
                            <p>Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.</p>
                            <h6 id="preserve-life">Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.</p>
                            <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among
                                them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>
                            <h6 id="blessed-healer">Blessed Healer</h6>
                            <p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s
                                level.</p>
                            <h6 id="divine-strike">Divine Strike</h6>
                            <p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the
                                target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
                            <h6 id="supreme-healing">Supreme Healing</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature,
                                you restore 12.</p>

                            <p>A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc
                                nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>
                            <p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre,
                                looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p>
                            <p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light
                                an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p>
                            <p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and
                                bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly
                                in the face.</p>
                            <h5 id="well-rounded-specialists">Well-Rounded Specialists</h5>
                            <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is
                                adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some
                                on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>
                            <h5 id="trained-for-danger">Trained for Danger</h5>
                            <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers,
                                trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p>
                            <p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he
                                or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>
                            <h5 id="creating-a-fighter">Creating a Fighter</h5>
                            <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless?
                                Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might
                                all have been factors.</p>
                            <p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested.
                                Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms,
                                or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.</p>
                            <h6>Quick Build</h6>
                            <p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest
                                score should be Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>

                            <p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.</p>
                            <h4 id="martial-archetypes">Martial Archetypes</h4>
                            <p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.</p>
                            <h5 id="champion">Champion</h5>
                            <p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.</p>
                            <h6>Improved Critical</h6>
                            <p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
                            <h6>Remarkable Athlete</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus.</p>
                            <p>In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.</p>
                            <h6>Additional Fighting Style</h6>
                            <p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.</p>
                            <h6>Superior Critical</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.</p>
                            <h6>Survivor</h6>
                            <p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don’t
                                gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p>

                            <p>Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the
                                shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p>
                            <p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the
                                assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p>
                            <p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p>
                            <p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that
                                is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>
                            <h5 id="skill-and-precision">Skill and Precision</h5>
                            <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception,
                                while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage
                                of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p>
                            <h5 id="a-shady-living">A Shady Living</h5>
                            <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’
                                guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators,
                                which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p>
                            <p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected
                                their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>
                            <h5 id="creating-a-rogue">Creating a Rogue</h5>
                            <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild
                                in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p>
                            <p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to
                                escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you
                                made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>
                            <h6>Quick Build</h6>
                            <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you plan
                                to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the criminal background.</p>

                            <p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
                                proficiencies.</p>
                            <p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>
                            <h5 id="sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</h5>
                            <p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack
                                must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>
                            <p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
                            <p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>
                            <h5 id="thieves-cant">Thieves’ Cant</h5>
                            <p>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such
                                messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>
                            <p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in
                                an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>
                            <h5 id="cunning-action">Cunning Action</h5>
                            <p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>
                            <h5 id="roguish-archetype">Roguish Archetype</h5>
                            <p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities. The Thief archetype is detailed here; see the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for other archetypes. Your choice grants you features at
                                3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>
                            <h5 id="rogue-ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h5>
                            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase
                                an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
                            <h5 id="uncanny-dodge">Uncanny Dodge</h5>
                            <p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>
                            <h5 id="evasion">Evasion</h5>
                            <p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
                                throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
                            <h5 id="reliable-talent">Reliable Talent</h5>
                            <p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
                            </p>
                            <h5 id="blindsense">Blindsense</h5>
                            <p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>
                            <h5 id="slippery-mind">Slippery Mind</h5>
                            <p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>
                            <h5 id="elusive">Elusive</h5>
                            <p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>
                            <h5 id="stroke-of-luck">Stroke of Luck</h5>
                            <p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll
                                as a 20.</p>
                            <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                            <h4 id="roguish-archetypes">Roguish Archetypes</h4>
                            <p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying
                                directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>
                            <h5 id="thief">Thief</h5>
                            <p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers,
                                delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.</p>
                            <h6>Fast Hands</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</p>
                            <h6>Second-Story Work</h6>
                            <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p>
                            <p>In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>
                            <h6>Supreme Sneak</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>
                            <h6>Use Magic Device</h6>
                            <p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>
                            <h6>Thief’s Reflexes</h6>
                            <p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second
                                turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.</p>

                                bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p>
                            <p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation.
                                A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p>
                            <p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly,
                                then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p>
                            <p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
                                and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down
                                from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p>

                            <p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires
                                merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless
                                hours of study.</p>
                            <p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from
                                ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p>
                            <h5 id="the-lure-of-knowledge">The Lure of Knowledge</h5>
                            <p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their
                                services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p>
                            <p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient
                                civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

                            <p>Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural
                                talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?</p>
                            <p>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re
                                simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.</p>

                            <h5 id="wizard-spellcasting">Spellcasting</h5>
                            <p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of <a href="#spellcasting">spellcasting</a>                                and chapter 11 for the <a href="#wizard-spells">wizard spell list</a>.</p>
                            <h6>Cantrips</h6>
                            <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Spellbook</h6>
                            <p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>
                            <h6>Preparing and Casting Spells</h6>
                            <p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
                                you finish a long rest.</p>
                            <p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells
                                must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen
                                from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                            <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the
                                spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                            <h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6>
                            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
                                you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                            <p class="formula"><b>Spell save <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span></b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                            <p class="formula"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                            <h6>Ritual Casting</h6>
                            <p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>
                            <h6>Spellcasting Focus</h6>
                            <p>You can use an arcane focus (found in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
                            <h6>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h6>
                            <p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you
                                might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “<a href="#your-spellbook">Your Spellbook</a>” sidebar).</p>
                            <h5 id="arcane-recovery">Arcane Recovery</h5>
                            <p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is
                                equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>

                            <p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The
                                school of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description; see the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for information on the other schools.</p>
                            <p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
                            <h5 id="wizard-ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h5>
                            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
                                score above 20 using this feature.</p>
                            <h5 id="spell-mastery">Spell Mastery</h5>
                            <p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest
                                level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
                            <p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>
                            <h5 id="signature-spells">Signature Spells</h5>
                            <p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared,
                                they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                            <p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
                            <h4 id="arcane-traditions">Arcane Traditions</h4>
                            <p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&amp;D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>
                            <p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in chapter
                                10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude
                                of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>
                            <h5 id="school-of-evocation">School of Evocation</h5>
                            <p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery
                                to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>
                            <h6>Evocation Savant</h6>
                            <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>
                            <h6>Sculpt Spells</h6>
                            <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them
                                equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>
                            <h6>Potent Cantrip</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any)
                                but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
                            <h6>Empowered Evocation</h6>
                            <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>
                            <h6>Overchannel</h6>
                            <p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p>
                            <p>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use
                                this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>
                            <aside>
                                <h6 id="your-spellbook">Your Spellbook</h6>
                                <p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other
                                    spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Copying a Spell into the Book.</dfn> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher
                                    and copy it.</p>
                                <p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the
                                    sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>
                                <p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once
                                    you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Replacing the Book.</dfn> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook,
                                    but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>
                                <p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.
                                    For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
                                <p><dfn>The Book’s Appearance.</dfn> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your
                                    master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>

                                <h6>Tika and Artemis: Contrasting Characters</h6>
                                <p>The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following two human fighters.</p>
                                <p>Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried
                                    to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity
                                    forced Tika into adventure alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable
                                    in her adventuring career.</p>
                                <p>Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one of the city’s hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years,
                                    he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the city’s pashas, who
                                    sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, constantly challenging himself to improve his skills.</p>
                                <p>Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.</p>

                            <h5 id="name">Name</h5>
                            <p>Your character’s race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you’re just picking one from a list.</p>
                            <h5 id="sex">Sex</h5>
                            <p>You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.
                                For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface.</p>
                            <p>You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You
                                could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is
                                for you to decide.</p>

                            <p>You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her
                                height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.</p>
                            <p>If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyond
                                the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.</p>
                            <p>For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it
                                by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 pounds (12 . 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.</p>

                            <p>You choose your character’s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp,
                                or a tattoo.</p>

                                <p>Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri set these characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove that she’s not just a kid any more, and her name
                                    makes her sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.</p>
                                <p>Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular
                                    features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and lifeless—betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.</p>

                            <h5 id="alignment">Alignment</h5>
                            <p>A typical creature in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral),
                                and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.</p>
                            <p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful
                                to the precepts of their alignment.</p>
                            <p><b>Lawful good</b> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</p>
                            <p><b>Neutral good</b> (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</p>
                            <p><b>Chaotic good</b> (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</p>
                            <p><b>Lawful neutral</b> (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</p>
                            <p><b>Neutral</b> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</p>
                            <p><b>Chaotic neutral</b> (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</p>
                            <p><b>Lawful evil</b> (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</p>
                            <p><b>Neutral evil</b> (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths are neutral evil.</p>
                            <p><b>Chaotic evil</b> (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</p>
                            <h6 id="alignment-in-the-multiverse">Alignment in the Multiverse</h6>
                            <p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created
                                these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p>
                            <p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc god, Gruumsh,
                                and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)</p>
                            <p>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to
                                be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p>
                            <p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are <b>unaligned</b>. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks
                                are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.</p>

                                <h6>Tika and Artemis: Alignment</h6>
                                <p>Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder.</p>
                                <p>As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must—and when it’s in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems
                                    in groups alongside others who don’t share their interests and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.</p>

                            <p>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.
                            </p>
                            <p>Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your DM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such
                                as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.</p>
                            <p>Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures
                                that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.</p>
                            <h5 id="personal-characteristics">Personal Characteristics</h5>
                            <p>Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics
                                are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you
                                can imagine.</p>
                            <p>Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p>
                            <h6 id="personality-traits">Personality Traits</h6>
                            <p>Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about
                                your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep”
                                tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.</p>
                            <p>Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability
                                scores.</p>
                            <p>A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome
                                a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.</p>
                            <h6 id="ideals">Ideals</h6>
                            <p>Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your
                                life goals to your core belief system.</p>
                            <p>Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important
                                thing you strive for?</p>
                            <p>You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law,
                                chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p>
                            <h6 id="bonds">Bonds</h6>
                            <p>Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you
                                to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.</p>
                            <p>Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?</p>
                            <p>Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.</p>
                            <h6 id="flaws">Flaws</h6>
                            <p>Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your
                                best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p>

                                <h6>Tika and Artemis: Personal Characteristics</h6>
                                <p>Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared for the worst and
                                    moves with a quick, precise confidence.</p>
                                <p>Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis
                                    Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.</p>
                                <p>Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the
                                    marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased as “I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the
                                    Last Home.”</p>
                                <p>Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent,
                                    some indication that if his life had gone differently, he might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin—he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt.
                                    His bond might be phrased as “I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do’Urden.”</p>
                                <p>Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be
                                    tempted to act against her principles if she’s convinced that a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal relationship and just wants to be left
                                    alone.</p>

                            <p>Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality
                                trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that

                            <h5 id="gaining-inspiration">Gaining Inspiration</h5>
                            <p>Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character
                                in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.</p>
                            <p>You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p>

                            <p>If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes
                                to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.</p>

                            <p>Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard
                                could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.</p>
                            <p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes
                                and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart
                                from ordinary people who share your background?</p>
                            <p>The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p>

                            <p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">chapter 7</a>.</p>
                            <p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>.</p>
                            <p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p>

                            <p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “<a href="#languages">Languages</a>” earlier in this chapter.</p>

                            <p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a> to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.</p>

                            <p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.</p>

                            <p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose
                                a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>. (If you spend coin, you can’t also
                                take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create
                                one.</p>

                                <p>Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest years as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid didn’t really change her, so she might choose the urchin background, gaining proficiency in the Sleight
                                    of Hand and Stealth skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade. Artemis is more defined by his criminal background, giving him skills in Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency with the tools of thievery
                                    and poison.</p>

                            <p>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order
                                to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p>
                            <p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Appendix B contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a
                                lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader
                                of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.</p>

                            <p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple,
                                shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where
                                you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</p>
                            <h6>Suggested Characteristics</h6>
                            <p>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and
                                ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.</p>

                            <p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort,
                                a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and
                                work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>
                            <p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass
                                it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>
                            <p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How
                                do the common people regard them?</p>
                            <p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares
                                what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>
                            <p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?
                            </p>
                            <p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>

                            <p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and
                                avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p>
                            <h6>Suggested Characteristics</h6>
                            <p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles
                                (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.</p>

                            <p>When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage
                                or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can
                                require an adventure or even a whole campaign.</p>

                            <p>Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other
                                ideals.</p>

                                rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.</p>

                    <p>The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of nations
                        and cultures. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical swords.</p>
                    <p>For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter
                        details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&amp;D present.</p>

                            <p>When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists
                                in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.</p>
                            <p>You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a
                                backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in
                                an ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.</p>

                            <p>Wealth appears in many forms in a D&amp;D world. Coins, gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your character’s financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what
                                they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin.
                                Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.</p>

                            <p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p>
                            <p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a quiver, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the
                                coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather,
                                the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p>
                            <p>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a set of dice, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn.</p>
                            <p>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p>
                            <p>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion
                                and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p>
                            <p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p>
                            <h6 id="selling-treasure">Selling Treasure</h6>
                            <p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can
                                find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.</dfn> As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition
                                to sell.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Magic Items.</dfn> Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common
                                magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.</dfn> These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures,
                                the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Trade Goods.</dfn> On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and
                                can be used as currency.</p>

                            <p>D&amp;D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly
                                plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy
                                armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p>
                            <p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of D&amp;D.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Armor Proficiency.</dfn> Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types
                                of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Armor Class (<span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span>).</dfn> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Heavy Armor.</dfn> Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the
                                wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Stealth.</dfn> If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Shields.</dfn> A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p>

                            <h5 id="light-armor">Light Armor</h5>
                            <p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor
                                type to determine your Armor Class.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Padded.</dfn> Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Leather.</dfn> The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Studded Leather.</dfn> Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p>
                            <h5 id="medium-armor">Medium Armor</h5>
                            <p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your
                                Armor Class.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Hide.</dfn> This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.
                            </p>
                            <p><dfn>Chain Shirt.</dfn> Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing
                                against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Scale Mail.</dfn> This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Breastplate.</dfn> This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs
                                while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Half Plate.</dfn> Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p>
                            <h5 id="heavy-armor">Heavy Armor</h5>
                            <p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p>
                            <p>Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ring Mail.</dfn> This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it’s usually worn only by those
                                who can’t afford better armor.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Chain Mail.</dfn> Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Splint.</dfn> This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Plate.</dfn> Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles
                                and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p>

                                <h6 id="equipment-sizes">Variant: Equipment Sizes</h6>
                                <p>In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won’t fit in a halfling’s leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed
                                    up in a cloud giant’s elegant robe.</p>
                                <p>The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries
                                    to wear it as a disguise.</p>
                                <p>Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost
                                    for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 . 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

                            <p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <b>simple</b> and <b>martial</b>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons
                                include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons
                                because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p>
                            <p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your

                            <h5 id="weapon-properties">Weapon Properties</h5>
                            <p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ammunition.</dfn> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition.
                                Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking
                                a minute to search the battlefield.</p>
                            <p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used
                                in this way.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Finesse.</dfn> When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Heavy.</dfn> Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Light.</dfn> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for <a href="#two-weapon-fighting">two-weapon fighting</a>                                in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Loading.</dfn> Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can
                                normally make.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Range.</dfn> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and
                                the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.
                            </p>
                            <p><dfn>Reach.</dfn> This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it (see <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Special.</dfn> A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Thrown.</dfn> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would
                                use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Two-Handed.</dfn> This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Versatile.</dfn> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>
                            <h6 id="improvised-weapons">Improvised Weapons</h6>
                            <p>Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a
                                wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p>
                            <p>In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as
                                if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p>
                            <p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have
                                the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>
                            <h6 id="silvered-weapons">Silvered Weapons</h6>
                            <p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces
                                of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p>
                            <h6 id="special-weapons">Special Weapons</h6>
                            <p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Lance.</dfn> You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Net.</dfn> A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>
                                10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (<span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p>
                            <p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>

                            <p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Acid.</dfn> As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature
                                or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Alchemist’s Fire.</dfn> This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating
                                the alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Dexterity check to extinguish
                                the flames.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Antitoxin.</dfn> A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Arcane Focus.</dfn> An arcane focus is a special item—an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item—designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer,
                                warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1206">chapter 10</a>.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ball Bearings.</dfn> As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Dexterity
                                saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Block and Tackle.</dfn> A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Book.</dfn> A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using
                                text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Caltrops.</dfn> As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage.
                                Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Candle.</dfn> For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Case, Crossbow Bolt.</dfn> This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Case, Map or Scroll.</dfn> This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Chain.</dfn> A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 20 Strength check.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Climber’s Kit.</dfn> A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point
                                where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Component Pouch.</dfn> A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components
                                that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell’s description).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Crowbar.</dfn> Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Druidic Focus.</dfn> A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur,
                                bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid (see chapter 3 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>) can use such an object as a spellcasting focus, as described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1206">chapter 10</a>.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Fishing Tackle.</dfn> This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Healer’s Kit.</dfn> This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing
                                to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Holy Symbol.</dfn> A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny
                                box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. The <i>Player’s Handbook</i> lists many gods in the multiverse and their typical symbols. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter
                                10. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Holy Water.</dfn> As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature,
                                treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.</p>
                            <p>A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Hunting Trap.</dfn> When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile
                                object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks
                                free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long).

                                attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an
                                additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage
                                to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Poison, Basic.</dfn> You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition
                                must make a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p>

                                this section).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Quiver.</dfn> A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ram, Portable.</dfn> You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.
                            </p>

                            <p><dfn>Scale, Merchant’s.</dfn> A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods,
                                to help determine their worth.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Spellbook.</dfn> Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p>

                            <p>A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying
                                capacity.</p>
                            <p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying
                                capacity together.</p>
                            <p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of D&amp;D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even
                                aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Barding.</dfn> Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent
                                armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Saddles.</dfn> A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic
                                or flying mount.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Vehicle Proficiency.</dfn> If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p><dfn>Rowed Vessels.</dfn> Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against
                                any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.</p>

                            <p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of
                                maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p>
                            <p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle
                                over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your
                                character’s career.</p>
                            <p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid
                                criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Wretched.</dfn> You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched
                                lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are
                                beneath the notice of most people.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Squalid.</dfn> You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent
                                environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They
                                might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Poor.</dfn> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant,
                                experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this
                                lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Modest.</dfn> A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or
                                thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.
                            </p>
                            <p><dfn>Comfortable.</dfn> Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a
                                fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Wealthy.</dfn> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that
                                of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn.
                                You likely have a small staff of servants.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Aristocratic.</dfn> You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms
                                in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful,
                                and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will
                                be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p>

                                <p>The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople
                                    to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own
                                    gear.</p>
                                <p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a>, you can eke out the equivalent
                                    of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p>

                            <p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts
                                with specialized adventuring skills.</p>
                            <p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific
                                task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund’s secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword.
                                A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p>
                            <p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer
                                establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a
                                long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p>
                            <p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require
                                more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p>
                            <h5 id="spellcasting-services">Spellcasting Services</h5>
                            <p>People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay
                                rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p>
                            <p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as <a class="spell" href="#cure-wounds">cure wounds</a> or <a class="spell" href="#identify">identify</a>,
                                is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large
                                city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from
                                a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race,
                        you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But a few players—with the DM’s permission—want to go a step further.</p>
                    <p>Chapter 6 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead
                        of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.</p>

                            <p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.</p>
                            <p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character
                                level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.</p>
                            <p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even
                                start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.</p>
                            <h5 id="multiclass-prerequisites">Prerequisites</h5>
                            <p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>. Without the full training
                                that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.</p>
                            <h5 id="multiclass-experience-points">Experience Points</h5>
                            <p>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class.</p>
                            <h5 id="multiclass-hit-points-and-hit-dice">Hit Points and Hit Dice</h5>
                            <p>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.</p>
                            <p>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track
                                of them separately.</p>
                            <h5 id="multiclass-proficiency-bonus">Proficiency Bonus</h5>
                            <p>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class.</p>
                            <h5 id="multiclass-proficiencies">Proficiencies</h5>
                            <p>When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies. See <a href="#howtoplayparent_1076">chapter 6</a> of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for more information.</p>
                            <h5 id="multiclass-class-features">Class Features</h5>
                            <p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features, however, have additional rules when you’re multiclassing. See <a href="#howtoplayparent_1076">chapter 6</a> of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for more information.

                            <p>At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless
                                the feat’s description says otherwise.</p>
                            <p>You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.</p>

                    <p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Strength</b>, measuring physical power</li>
                        <li><b>Dexterity</b>, measuring agility</li>
                        <li><b>Constitution</b>, measuring endurance</li>
                        <li><b>Intelligence</b>, measuring reasoning and memory</li>
                        <li><b>Wisdom</b>, measuring perception and insight</li>
                        <li><b>Charisma</b>, measuring force of personality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.</p>
                    <p>The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived
                        from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.</p>
                    <p>This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>.</p>

                            <p>Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities
                                related to that ability.</p>
                            <p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as
                                20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p>
                            <p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from .5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible
                                ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p>
                            <p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).</p>
                            <p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher
                                of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,
                                you use the 17.</p>
                            <p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one
                                additional d20.</p>
                            <p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage
                                or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>
                            <p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage
                                on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p>
                            <p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration (see <a href="#howtoplayparent_1001">chapter 4</a>) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character’s personality, ideals,
                                or bonds. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p>

                            <p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws,
                                and attack rolls.</p>
                            <p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus
                                only once when you make the save.</p>
                            <p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks.
                                If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p>
                            <p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For
                                that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your
                                proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p>
                            <p>In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p>

                            <p>An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that
                                has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p>
                            <p>For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>. The Typical
                                Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>
                            <p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>. If the total equals or exceeds the <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>, the ability check is
                                a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the
                                DM.</p>
                            <h5 id="contests">Contests</h5>
                            <p>Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that
                                has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed.
                                In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>
                            <p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>, they compare the totals of their two checks. The
                                participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>
                            <p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither
                                character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p>
                            <h5 id="skills">Skills</h5>
                            <p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates
                                a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)</p>
                            <p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand,
                                and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>
                            <p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated
                                with an ability.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In
                                either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p>
                            <p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the
                                Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p>
                            <h6 id="skills-with-different-abilities">Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h6>
                            <p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably
                                apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example,
                                if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency
                                in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.
                                Similarly, when your dwarf fighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p>
                            <h5 id="passive-checks">Passive Checks</h5>
                            <p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can
                                be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p>
                            <p>Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:</p>
                            <p class="formula">10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>
                            <p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <b>score</b>.</p>
                            <p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.</p>
                            <p>The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a>.</p>
                            <h5 id="working-together">Working Together</h5>
                            <p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other
                                characters. In combat, this requires the <a href="#help">Help action</a> (see <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>).</p>
                            <p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another
                                character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p>
                            <h6 id="group-checks">Group Checks</h6>
                            <p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.</p>
                            <p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p>
                            <p>Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check
                                to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger.
                                Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>

                            <h5 id="strength">Strength</h5>
                            <p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</p>
                            <h6>Strength Checks</h6>
                            <p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of
                                Strength checks.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="strength-athletics">Athletics.</dfn> Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li>
                                <li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li>
                                <li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous cur.rents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwa.ter or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><dfn>Other Strength Checks.</dfn> The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>
                                <li>Break free of bonds</li>
                                <li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>
                                <li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>
                                <li>Tip over a statue</li>
                                <li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6>Attack Rolls and Damage</h6>
                            <p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some
                                of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>
                            <h6 id="lifting-and-carrying">Lifting and Carrying</h6>
                            <p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Carrying Capacity.</dfn> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Push, Drag, or Lift.</dfn> You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your
                                speed drops to 5 feet.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Size and Strength.</dfn> Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift.
                                For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p>
                            <h6 id="encumbrance">Variant: Encumbrance</h6>
                            <p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore
                                the Strength column of the Armor table in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>.</p>
                            <p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <b>encumbered</b>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p>
                            <p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead <b>heavily encumbered</b>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks,
                                attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p>
                            <h5 id="dexterity">Dexterity</h5>
                            <p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p>
                            <h6>Dexterity Checks</h6>
                            <p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="dexterity-acrobatics">Acrobatics.</dfn> Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope,
                                or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="dexterity-sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand.</dfn> Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight
                                of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="dexterity-stealth">Stealth.</dfn> Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or
                                heard.</p>
                            <aside>
                                <h6 id="hiding">Hiding</h6>
                                <p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception)
                                    check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>
                                <p>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can’t be seen, so it can always try
                                    to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.</p>
                                <p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to
                                    stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Passive Perception.</dfn> When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with
                                    that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.</p>
                                <p>For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>
                                <p><dfn>What Can You See?</dfn> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <b>lightly</b> or <b>heavily obscured</b>, as explained
                                    in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a>.</p>

                            <p><dfn>Other Dexterity Checks.</dfn> The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li>
                                <li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li>
                                <li>Pick a lock</li>
                                <li>Disable a trap</li>
                                <li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li>

                                <li>Craft a small or detailed object</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6>Attack Rolls and Damage</h6>
                            <p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when
                                attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p>
                            <h6>Armor Class</h6>
                            <p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>.</p>
                            <h6>Initiative</h6>
                            <p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. <a href="#initiative">Initiative</a> determines the order of creatures’ turns in

                            <h5 id="constitution">Constitution</h5>
                            <p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>
                            <h6>Constitution Checks</h6>
                            <p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A
                                Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p>
                            <p>The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hold your breath</li>
                                <li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>
                                <li>Go without sleep</li>
                                <li>Survive without food or water</li>
                                <li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6>Hit Points</h6>
                            <p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p>
                            <p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution
                                modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your
                                new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>
                            <h5 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h5>
                            <p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p>
                            <h6>Intelligence Checks</h6>
                            <p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence
                                checks.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="intelligence-arcana">Arcana.</dfn> Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants
                                of those planes.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="intelligence-history">History.</dfn> Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="intelligence-investigation">Investigation.</dfn> When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object,
                                discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge
                                might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="intelligence-nature">Nature.</dfn> Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="intelligence-religion">Religion.</dfn> Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Other Intelligence Checks.</dfn> The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>
                                <li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>
                                <li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>
                                <li>Forge a document</li>
                                <li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>
                                <li>Win a game of skill</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6>
                            <p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>
                            <h5 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h5>
                            <p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p>
                            <h6>Wisdom Checks</h6>
                            <p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival
                                skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="wisdom-animal-handling">Animal Handling.</dfn> When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for
                                a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="wisdom-insight">Insight.</dfn> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves
                                gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="wisdom-medicine">Medicine.</dfn> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="wisdom-perception">Perception.</dfn> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your
                                senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy
                                to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p>

                                <h6 id="finding-a-hidden-object">Finding a Hidden Object</h6>
                                <p>When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues
                                    that you might otherwise overlook.</p>
                                <p>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell
                                    the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were
                                    opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.</p>
                            </aside>
                            <p><dfn id="wisdom-survival">Survival.</dfn> The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict
                                the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Other Wisdom Checks.</dfn> The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
                                <li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living crea.ture is undead</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6>
                            <p>Clerics use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>
                            <h5 id="charisma">Charisma</h5>
                            <p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>
                            <h6>Charisma Checks</h6>
                            <p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance,
                                and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="charisma-deception">Deception.</dfn> Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading
                                others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false
                                assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="charisma-intimidation">Intimidation.</dfn> When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples
                                include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="charisma-performance">Performance.</dfn> Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p>
                            <p><dfn id="charisma-persuasion">Persuasion.</dfn> When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you
                                use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating
                                peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Other Charisma Checks.</dfn> The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>

                            <p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>

                            <p>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character
                                or monster is at risk of harm.</p>
                            <p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p>
                            <p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.</p>
                            <p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency
                                bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>
                            <p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.
                            </p>
                            <p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Delving into the ancient Tomb of Horrors, slipping through the back alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—these are the things that Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures are made of.
                        Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking
                        on a new adventure.</p>
                    <p>This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your character
                        might pursue between adventures.</p>
                    <p>Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s introduction:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The DM describes the environment.</li>
                        <li>The players describe what they want to do.</li>
                        <li>The DM narrates the results of their actions.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find
                        as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers’ actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.</p>

                            <p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment,
                                the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of <b>minutes</b>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to
                                search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p>
                            <p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <b>hours</b> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.
                            </p>
                            <p>For long journeys, a scale of <b>days</b> works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p>
                            <p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on <b>rounds</b>, a 6-second span of time described in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>.</p>

                            <p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key role in D&amp;D adventures.</p>
                            <p>The DM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly
                                a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of
                                echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”</p>
                            <p>Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel
                                pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.</p>
                            <h5 id="speed">Speed</h5>
                            <p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.
                            </p>
                            <p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
                            <h6 id="travel-pace">Travel Pace</h6>
                            <p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast
                                pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the “<a href="#activity-while-traveling">Activity While Traveling</a>”
                                section later in this chapter for more information).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Forced March.</dfn> The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>
                            <p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> is 10 + 1
                                for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Mounts and Vehicles.</dfn> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast
                                pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>
                            <p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (<a href="#mounts-and-vehicles">see <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a></a>),
                                and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>
                            <p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> contains more information on special methods of travel.</p>

                            <h6 id="travel-in-difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h6>
                            <p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains,
                                and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.</p>
                            <p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
                            <h5 id="special-types-of-movement">Special Types of Movement</h5>
                            <p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>
                            <h6 id="climbing-swimming-and-crawling">Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h6>
                            <p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with
                                few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
                            <h6 id="jumping">Jumping</h6>
                            <p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Long Jump.</dfn> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half
                                that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>
                            <p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM’s option, you must succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter
                                of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>
                            <p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p>
                            <p><dfn>High Jump.</dfn> When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump,
                                you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally
                                can.</p>
                            <p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1. times your height.</p>
                            <h5 id="activity-while-traveling">Activity While Traveling</h5>
                            <p>As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group’s journey.</p>
                            <h6 id="marching-order">Marching Order</h6>
                            <p>The adventurers should establish a marching order. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when
                                a fight breaks out.</p>
                            <p>A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching
                                order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Fewer Than Three Ranks.</dfn> If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, it’s considered a front rank.</p>
                            <h6 id="stealth">Stealth</h6>
                            <p>While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in
                                <a href="#hiding">chapter 7</a>.</p>
                            <aside>
                                <h6 id="splitting-up-the-party">Splitting Up the Party</h6>
                                <p>Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle,
                                    and back ranks.</p>
                                <p>The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies
                                    that clumsier characters would alert. A pair of rogues moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf fighter friend behind.</p>
                            </aside>
                            <h6 id="noticing-threats">Noticing Threats</h6>
                            <p>Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example,
                                as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and
                                middle ranks cannot.</p>
                            <p>While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Encountering Creatures.</dfn> If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate
                                a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Surprising Foes.</dfn> If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See <a href="#surprise">chapter 9</a>                                for more about surprise.</p>
                            <h6 id="other-activities">Other Activities</h6>
                            <p>Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing hidden
                                threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the DM’s permission.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Navigate.</dfn> The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> has rules to determine whether the group gets
                                lost.)</p>

                            <p><dfn>Track.</dfn> A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> has rules for tracking.)</p>

                            <p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the
                                environment in such places. The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> has rules covering more unusual situations.</p>
                            <h5 id="falling">Falling</h5>
                            <p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.</p>
                            <p>At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p>
                            <h5 id="suffocating">Suffocating</h5>
                            <p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p>
                            <p>When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying,&nbsp;and it can’t regain
                                hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p>
                            <p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p>
                            <h5 id="vision-and-light">Vision and Light</h5>
                            <p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects
                                that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p>
                            <p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a <b>lightly obscured</b> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
                            <p>A <b>heavily obscured</b> area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see <a href="#blinded">appendix A</a>)&nbsp;when
                                trying to see something in that area.</p>
                            <p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p>
                            <p><b>Bright light</b> lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p>
                            <p><b>Dim light</b>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and
                                dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>
                            <p><b>Darkness</b> creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

                            <h6 id="blindsight">Blindsight</h6>
                            <p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true
                                dragons, have this sense.</p>
                            <h6 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h6>
                            <p>Many creatures in the worlds of D&amp;D, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness
                                are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                            <h6 id="truesight">Truesight</h6>
                            <p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive
                                the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>
                            <h5 id="food-and-water">Food and Water</h5>
                            <p>Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see <a href="#exhaustion">appendix A</a>). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be
                                removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p>
                            <h6 id="food">Food</h6>
                            <p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p>
                            <p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>
                            <p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p>
                            <h6 id="water">Water</h6>
                            <p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion
                                at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>
                            <p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p>
                            <h5 id="interacting-with-objects">Interacting with Objects</h5>
                            <p>A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything
                                happens.</p>
                            <p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character
                                might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p>
                            <p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines
                                an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and
                                Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p>
                            <p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> for any such check.</p>

                            <p>Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&amp;D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.</p>
                            <p>Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters
                                who are participating in the interaction that don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a <b>nonplayer character</b> (NPC).</p>
                            <p>In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want
                                from a friendly NPC, of course.</p>
                            <p>Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.</p>
                            <h5 id="roleplaying">Roleplaying</h5>
                            <p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.</p>
                            <p>Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.</p>
                            <p>There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.</p>
                            <h6 id="descriptive-approach-to-roleplaying">Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying</h6>
                            <p>With this approach, you describe your character’s words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.</p>
                            <p>For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a
                                conversation with the dwarf.</p>
                            <p>Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.”</p>
                            <p>In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude and actions.</p>
                            <p>When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.</li>
                                <li>Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.</li>
                                <li>Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.</p>
                            <h6 id="active-approach-to-roleplaying">Active Approach to Roleplaying</h6>
                            <p>If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.</p>
                            <p>When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character’s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying,
                                though you still need to describe things that can’t be reasonably acted out.</p>
                            <p>Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:</p>
                            <p>Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, “I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then
                                adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”</p>
                            <h6 id="results-of-roleplaying">Results of Roleplaying</h6>
                            <p>The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.</p>
                            <p>When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to
                                influence the NPC’s attitude.</p>
                            <p>Interactions in D&amp;D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything
                                you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.</p>
                            <h5 id="interaction-ability-checks">Ability Checks</h5>
                            <p>In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.</p>
                            <p>Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants
                                the dice to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM’s discretion.</p>
                            <p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick
                                a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.</p>

                                for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.</p>
                            <p>Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.</p>
                            <h5 id="short-rest">Short Rest</h5>
                            <p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.</p>
                            <p>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die
                                and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon
                                finishing a long rest, as explained below.</p>
                            <h5 id="long-rest">Long Rest</h5>
                            <p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted
                                by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p>
                            <p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example,
                                if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p>
                            <p>A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>

                            <p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms
                                and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p>
                            <p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in
                                general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p>
                            <h5 id="resting-lifestyle-expenses">Lifestyle Expenses</h5>
                            <p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in <a href="#lifestyle-expenses">chapter 5</a>.</p>
                            <p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be
                                easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p>
                            <h5 id="downtime-activities">Downtime Activities</h5>
                            <p>Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you
                                gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can
                                keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>
                            <p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.</p>
                            <h6 id="crafting">Crafting</h6>
                            <p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to
                                special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p>
                            <p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft
                                has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p>
                            <p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes
                                5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost
                                of 750 gp.</p>
                            <p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a> for more information on lifestyle expenses).</p>
                            <h6 id="practicing-a-profession">Practicing a Profession</h6>
                            <p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day (see <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a> for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice
                                your profession.</p>
                            <p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p>
                            <p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p>
                            <h6 id="recuperating">Recuperating</h6>
                            <p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p>
                            <p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regain.ing hit points.</li>
                                <li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6 id="researching">Researching</h6>
                            <p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library
                                or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.</p>
                            <p>When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a
                                specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma
                                (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.</p>
                            <p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>).</p>
                            <h6 id="training">Training</h6>
                            <p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might allow additional training options.</p>
                            <p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.</p>
                            <p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from a wizard’s spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting
                        through the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&amp;D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.</p>
                    <p>This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address
                        you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or monster that you control.</p>

                            <p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
                                <b>round</b> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <b>turn</b>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative.
                                Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>

                                    <li>Establish positions. <span>The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located.

                            <h5 id="surprise">Surprise</h5>
                            <p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations,
                                one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p>
                            <p>The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception)
                                score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p>
                            <p>If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.
                            </p>
                            <h5 id="initiative">Initiative</h5>
                            <p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical
                                creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p>
                            <p>The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order
                                remains the same from round to round.</p>
                            <p>If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character.
                                Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>
                            <h5 id="your-turn">Your Turn</h5>
                            <p>On your turn, you can <b>move</b> a distance up to your speed and <b>take one action</b>. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character
                                sheet.</p>
                            <p>The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>
                            <p>The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.</p>
                            <p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”</p>
                            <h6 id="bonus-actions">Bonus Actions</h6>
                            <p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus
                                action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.</p>
                            <p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p>
                            <p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
                            </p>
                            <h6 id="other-activity-on-your-turn">Other Activity on Your Turn</h6>
                            <p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p>
                            <p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>
                            <p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon
                                as part of the same action you use to attack.</p>
                            <p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
                            <p>The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door
                                or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>

                            <p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity
                                attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.</p>

                            <p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p>
                            <p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part
                                of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p>
                            <p>The “Special Types of Movement” section in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a> gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.</p>
                            <h5 id="breaking-up-your-move">Breaking Up Your Move</h5>
                            <p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>
                            <h6 id="moving-between-attacks">Moving between Attacks</h6>
                            <p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and
                                who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>
                            <h6 id="using-different-speeds">Using Different Speeds</h6>
                            <p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new
                                speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p>
                            <h5 id="difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h5>
                            <p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>
                            <p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p>
                            <p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>
                            <h5 id="being-prone">Being Prone</h5>
                            <p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.</p>
                            <p>You can <b>drop prone</b> without using any of your speed. <b>Standing up</b> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of
                                movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
                            <p>To move while prone, you must <b>crawl</b> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p>
                            <h5 id="moving-around-other-creatures">Moving Around Other Creatures</h5>
                            <p>You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space
                                is difficult terrain for you.</p>
                            <p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.</p>
                            <p>If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p>
                            <h5 id="flying-movement">Flying Movement</h5>
                            <p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature
                                falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.</p>
                            <h5 id="creature-size">Creature Size</h5>
                            <p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>

                            <h6 id="space">Space</h6>
                            <p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If
                                a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>
                            <p>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures
                                can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p>
                            <p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures
                                can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>
                            <h6 id="squeezing-into-a-smaller-space">Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h6>
                            <p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature
                                must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.</p>

                                <h6 id="playing-on-a-grid">Variant: Playing on a Grid</h6>
                                <p>If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Squares.</dfn> Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Speed.</dfn> Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the
                                    speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.</p>
                                <p>If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Entering a Square.</dfn> To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for
                                    the sake of smooth play. The <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)</p>
                                <p>If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult
                                    terrain.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Corners.</dfn> Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.</p>
                                <p><dfn>Ranges.</dfn> To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by
                                    the shortest route.</p>

                            <p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their
                                own in their stat blocks.</p>
                            <p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>
                            <h5 id="attack">Attack</h5>
                            <p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p>
                            <p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “<a href="#making-an-attack">Making an Attack</a>” section for the rules that govern attacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p>
                            <h5 id="cast-a-spell">Cast a Spell</h5>
                            <p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction,
                                minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a
                                spell. See chapter 10 for the rules on <a href="#spellcasting">spellcasting</a>.</p>
                            <h5 id="dash">Dash</h5>
                            <p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you
                                dash.</p>
                            <p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p>
                            <h5 id="disengage">Disengage</h5>
                            <p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>
                            <h5 id="dodge">Dodge</h5>
                            <p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws
                                with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.</p>
                            <h5 id="help">Help</h5>
                            <p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided
                                that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p>
                            <p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target
                                before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p>
                            <h5 id="hide">Hide</h5>
                            <p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">chapter 7</a> for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets”
                                section later in this chapter.</p>
                            <h5 id="ready">Ready</h5>
                            <p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p>
                            <p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If
                                the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”</p>
                            <p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>
                            <p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic
                                requires concentration (explained in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1206">chapter 10</a>). If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell
                                ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>

                            <p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

                            <p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful
                                when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p>

                                <p>Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to
                                    the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character’s ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1091">chapter 7</a> for inspiration as you improvise.</p>
                                <p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>

                            <p>Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p>
                            <ol class="labeled">
                                <li>Choose a target. <span>Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.</span></li>
                                <li>Determine modifiers. <span>The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</span></li>
                                <li>Resolve the attack. <span>You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</span></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.</p>
                            <h5 id="attack-rolls">Attack Rolls</h5>
                            <p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s
                                Armor Class (<span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span>), the attack hits. The <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> of a monster is in its stat block.</p>
                            <h6 id="modifiers-to-the-roll">Modifiers to the Roll</h6>
                            <p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its
                                stat block.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Ability Modifier.</dfn> The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this
                                rule.</p>
                            <p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, as explained in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1206">chapter 10</a>.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Proficiency Bonus.</dfn> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p>
                            <h6 id="rolling-1-or-20">Rolling 1 or 20</h6>
                            <p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p>
                            <p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span>. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.</p>
                            <p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span>.</p>
                            <h5 id="unseen-attackers-and-targets">Unseen Attackers and Targets</h5>
                            <p>Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.</p>
                            <p>When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t
                                in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.</p>
                            <p>When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.</p>
                            <p>If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p>
                            <h5 id="ranged-attacks">Ranged Attacks</h5>
                            <p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged
                                attack.</p>
                            <h6 id="range">Range</h6>
                            <p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p>
                            <p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.</p>
                            <p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond
                                normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.</p>
                            <h6 id="ranged-attacks-in-close-combat">Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h6>
                            <p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature
                                who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.</p>
                            <h5 id="melee-attacks">Melee Attacks</h5>
                            <p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when
                                it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p>
                            <p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <b>reach</b> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet,
                                as noted in their descriptions.</p>
                            <p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <b>unarmed strike</b>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning
                                damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>
                            <h6 id="opportunity-attacks">Opportunity Attacks</h6>
                            <p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.</p>
                            <p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack
                                occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.</p>
                            <p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction.
                                For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p>
                            <h6 id="two-weapon-fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</h6>
                            <p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t
                                add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>
                            <p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>
                            <h6 id="grappling">Grappling</h6>
                            <p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>
                            <p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested
                                by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the <a href="#grappled">grappled</a>                                condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p>
                            <p><dfn>Escaping a Grapple.</dfn> A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
                            </p>
                            <p><dfn>Moving a Grappled Creature.</dfn> When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p>
                            <h6 id="shoving-a-creature">Shoving a Creature</h6>
                            <p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of
                                them.</p>
                            <p>The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
                                (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.</p>

                                <p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a
                                    creature. The DM can use these contests as models for improvising others.</p>

                            <p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the
                                cover.</p>
                            <p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives
                                half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p>
                            <p>A target with <b>half cover</b> has a +2 bonus to <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow
                                tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p>

A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow

                            <p>A target with <b>total cover</b> can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed

                            <p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the worlds of D&amp;D. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even
                                kill, the hardiest of creatures.</p>
                            <h5 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h5>
                            <p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p>
                            <p>A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p>
                            <p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p>
                            <h5 id="damage-rolls">Damage Rolls</h5>
                            <p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can
                                grant a bonus to damage.</p>
                            <p>When attacking with a <b>weapon</b>, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A <b>spell</b> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.
                            </p>
                            <p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <b>more than one target</b> at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball or a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is
                                rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p>
                            <h6 id="critical-hits">Critical Hits</h6>
                            <p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up
                                play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack
                                feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p>
                            <h6 id="damage-types">Damage Types</h6>
                            <p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p>
                            <p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new effect.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Acid.</dfn> The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Bludgeoning.</dfn> Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Cold.</dfn> The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Fire.</dfn> Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Force.</dfn> Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Lightning.</dfn> A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Necrotic.</dfn> Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and some spells, withers matter and even the soul.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Piercing.</dfn> Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Poison.</dfn> Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Psychic.</dfn> Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Radiant.</dfn> Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Slashing.</dfn> Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Thunder.</dfn> A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.</p>
                            <h6 id="describing-the-effects-of-damage">Describing the Effects of Damage</h6>
                            <p>Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum,
                                you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.
                            </p>
                            <h5 id="damage-resistance-and-vulnerability">Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h5>
                            <p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p>
                            <p>If a creature or an object has <b>resistance</b> to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has <b>vulnerability</b> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p>
                            <p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also
                                within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p>
                            <p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage
                                of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>
                            <h5 id="healing">Healing</h5>
                            <p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points (as explained in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a>), and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a
                                potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.</p>
                            <p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost.
                                For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p>
                            <p>A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.</p>
                            <h5 id="dropping-to-0-hit-points">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h5>
                            <p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p>
                            <h6 id="instant-death">Instant Death</h6>
                            <p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p>
                            <p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point
                                maximum, the cleric dies.</p>
                            <h6 id="falling-unconscious">Falling Unconscious</h6>
                            <p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall <a href="#unconscious">unconscious</a> (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain
                                any hit points.</p>
                            <h6 id="death-saving-throws">Death Saving Throws</h6>
                            <p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t
                                tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p>
                            <p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and
                                failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Rolling 1 or 20.</dfn> When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p>
                            <p><dfn>Damage at 0 Hit Points.</dfn> If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or
                                exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.</p>
                            <h6 id="stabilizing-a-creature">Stabilizing a Creature</h6>
                            <p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p>
                            <p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>
                            <p>A <b>stable</b> creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage.
                                A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>
                            <h6 id="monsters-and-death">Monsters and Death</h6>
                            <p>Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.</p>
                            <p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.</p>
                            <h5 id="knocking-a-creature-out">Knocking a Creature Out</h5>
                            <p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this
                                choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.</p>
                            <h5 id="temporary-hit-points">Temporary Hit Points</h5>
                            <p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p>
                            <p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage,
                                you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p>
                            <p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>
                            <p>Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if
                                a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>
                            <p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p>
                            <p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>

                            <p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p>
                            <p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p>
                            <h6 id="mounting-and-dismounting">Mounting and Dismounting</h6>
                            <p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement
                                to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
                            <p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted,
                                you must make the same saving throw.</p>
                            <p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.</p>
                            <h5 id="controlling-a-mount">Controlling a Mount</h5>
                            <p>While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p>
                            <p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when
                                you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p>
                            <p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour
                                a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p>
                            <p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p>

                                <li>For other any case go to 4</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li>
                            You didn’t notice it, but on a tree a goblin is the watchman of the camp. And he is pointing you with his longbow, he has the opportunity of shot you before you notice. Roll two dice <strong class="roll-dice">d20</strong> because of the advantage and pick the higher. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Roll is 1 go to 13</li>
                                <li>Roll is 20 go to 12</li>
                                <li>Adding the goblin proficiente bonus for bow is over your AC go to 11</li>
                                <li>For other any case go to 13</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            You miss the shot, the arrow hits the tree and now the goblin can see you.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Go to 5</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Now you are face to face. Roll initiative, for your character add the Dexterity modifier (+3) <strong class="roll-dice">d20+3</strong>. Roll one <strong class="roll-dice">d20</strong> for all the other foes criatures.
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you have the higher roll, go to 9</li>
                                <li>Goblin has the higher roll, go to 8</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            You draw the bow, your breath stops and the silence surrounds you. When you release the arrow he goes straight to goblin faster than never. It’s a critical hit.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Go to 10 and roll the double of dice for damage.</li>

                            <li>
                            Your arrow hits the goblin and he fall dead from the tree.

                            <li>
                            The goblin draws his bow and shots you. Roll a <strong class="roll-dice">d20</strong> for attack roll.
                            <ul>
                                <li>If roll is 1 go to 9</li>
                                <li>If roll is 20 go to 12</li>
                                <li>If adding the goblin's shortbow modifier to hit (+4) is over your AC go to 11</li>
                                <li>In other case go to 9</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li>
                            Is your turn to roll attack. Roll a <strong class="roll-dice">d20</strong>.
                            <ul>
                                <li>If roll is 1 go to 8</li>
                                <li>If roll is 20 go to 6</li>
                                <li>If adding your proficience bow bonus (+2) is over the goblin AC go to 10</li>
                                <li>In other case go to 8</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            The arrow hits the goblin and now you can roll damage. Roll <strong class="roll-dice">d6</strong> the bow damage and subtract the quantity to the goblin hit points. In case of a critical hit <strong class="roll-dice">2d6</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the goblin hit points are 0 go to 7</li>
                                <li>If the goblin still having hit points go to 8</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            The arrow have hit you. Now roll <strong class="roll-dice">d6+2</strong> for goblin's shortbow damage and subtract the number to your hit points. In case of a critical hit <strong class="roll-dice">2d6+2</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If your hit points are beyond 0 go to 14</li>
                                <li>If you have more hit points go to 9</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            The goblin eyes bright red, he draws his bow, and the arrow crosses the air directly to you. It’s a critical hit.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Go to 11 and roll the double of dice for damage.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Meanwhile you were looking to the floor, a arrow strikes in front of you. The origin of the arrow is a goblin in a tree.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Go to 5</li>

                            <li>
                            You are unstable, you can’t attack. The goblin is coming to you. You should roll a death saving throw. Nobody will need help you, you are going to die alone.

                            <p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw
                                magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.</p>
                            <p>Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove <a href="#conditions">conditions</a> (see appendix A),
                                drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.</p>
                            <p>Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the
                                minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p>

                                <h6 id="the-schools-of-magic">The Schools of Magic</h6>
                                <p>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether
                                    it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.</p>
                                <p>The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.</p>
                                <p><b>Abjuration</b> spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.</p>
                                <p><b>Conjuration</b> spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another
                                    location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.</p>
                                <p><b>Divination</b> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.</p>
                                <p><b>Enchantment</b> spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another
                                    creature like a puppet.</p>
                                <p><b>Evocation</b> spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.</p>
                                <p><b>Illusion</b> spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions
                                    create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</p>
                                <p><b>Necromancy</b> spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.</p>
                                <p>Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.</p>
                                <p><b>Transmutation</b> spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or
                                    enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</p>

                            <h5 id="spell-level">Spell Level</h5>
                            <p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredible time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful
                                spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p>
                            <p>Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p>
                            <h5 id="known-and-prepared-spells">Known and Prepared Spells</h5>
                            <p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed
                                in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.</p>
                            <p>In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.</p>
                            <h5 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h5>
                            <p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically
                                and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For
                                example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.</p>
                            <p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot,
                                larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level
                                slots and has three remaining.</p>
                            <p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see <a href="#howtoplayparent_1126">chapter 8</a> for the rules on <a href="#resting">resting</a>).</p>
                            <p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots.</p>
                            <h6 id="casting-a-spell-at-a-higher-level">Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</h6>
                            <p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that
                                magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p>
                            <p>Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.</p>
                            <h5 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h5>
                            <p>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce
                                the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.</p>
                            <h5 id="rituals">Rituals</h5>
                            <p>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.
                                It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.</p>
                            <p>To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list
                                of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.</p>

                            <p>When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.</p>
                            <p>Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.</p>

                                <h6 id="casting-in-armor">Casting in Armor</h6>
                                <p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for
                                    spellcasting.</p>
                            </aside>
                            <h5 id="casting-time">Casting Time</h5>
                            <p>Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p>
                            <h6 id="bonus-action-casting-time">Bonus Action</h6>
                            <p>A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same
                                turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</p>
                            <h6 id="reaction-casting-time">Reactions</h6>
                            <p>Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can
                                do so.</p>
                            <h6 id="longer-casting-times">Longer Casting Times</h6>
                            <p>Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting
                                the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell
                                again, you must start over.</p>
                            <h5 id="spell-range">Range</h5>
                            <p>The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like <a class="spell" href="#magic-missile">magic missile</a>, the target is a creature. For a
                                spell like <a class="spell" href="#fireball">fireball</a>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p>
                            <p>Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the <a class="spell" href="#shield">shield</a>                                spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p>
                            <p>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect” later in the this chapter).
                            </p>
                            <p>Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.</p>
                            <h5 id="components">Components</h5>
                            <p>A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more
                                of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.</p>
                            <h6 id="verbal-components">Verbal (V)</h6>
                            <p>Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion.
                                Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the <a class="spell" href="#silence">silence</a> spell, can’t cast a spell with
                                a verbal component.</p>
                            <h6 id="somatic-components">Somatic (S)</h6>
                            <p>Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.
                            </p>
                            <h6 id="material-components">Material (M)</h6>
                            <p>Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a <b>component pouch</b> or a <b>spellcasting focus</b> (found in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1021">chapter 5</a>) in place of the components specified
                                for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p>
                            <p>If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.</p>
                            <p>A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p>
                            <h5 id="duration">Duration</h5>
                            <p>A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p>
                            <h6 id="instantaneous">Instantaneous</h6>
                            <p>Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.</p>
                            <h6 id="concentration">Concentration</h6>
                            <p>Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p>
                            <p>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>
                            <p>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Casting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concen.trate on two spells at once.</li>
                                <li>Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentra.tion. The <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is
                                    higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>
                                <li>Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a
                                spell.</p>
                            <h5 id="targets">Targets</h5>
                            <p>A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described
                                below).</p>
                            <p>Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts,
                                typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.</p>
                            <h6 id="a-clear-path-to-the-target">A Clear Path to the Target</h6>
                            <p>To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.</p>
                            <p>If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.</p>
                            <h6 id="targeting-yourself">Targeting Yourself</h6>
                            <p>If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.</p>
                            <h5 id="areas-of-effect">Areas of Effect</h5>
                            <p>Spells such as <a class="spell" href="#burning-hands">burning hands</a> and <a class="spell" href="#cone-of-cold">cone of cold</a>                                cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.</p>
                            <p>A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a <b>point of origin</b>, a location from which the spell’s
                                energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p>
                            <p>A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area.
                                To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in <a href="#howtoplayparent_1161">chapter 9</a>.</p>
                            <h6 id="cone">Cone</h6>
                            <p>A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.</p>
                            <p>A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>
                            <h6 id="cube">Cube</h6>
                            <p>You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.</p>
                            <p>A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>
                            <h6 id="cylinder">Cylinder</h6>
                            <p>A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands
                                in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the
                                cylinder.</p>
                            <p>A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.</p>
                            <h6 id="line">Line</h6>
                            <p>A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.</p>
                            <p>A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>
                            <h6 id="sphere">Sphere</h6>
                            <p>You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.</p>
                            <p>A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.</p>
                            <h5 id="spell-saving-throws">Saving Throws</h5>
                            <p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p>
                            <p>The <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p>
                            <h5 id="spell-attack-rolls">Attack Rolls</h5>
                            <p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>
                            <p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see chapter
                                9).</p>
                            <h5 id="combining-magical-effects">Combining Magical Effects</h5>
                            <p>The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from
                                those castings applies while their durations overlap.</p>
                            <p>For example, if two clerics cast <a class="spell" href="#bless">bless</a> on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t
                                get to roll two bonus dice.</p>
                            <aside>
                                <h6 id="the-weave-of-magic">The Weave of Magic</h6>
                                <p>The worlds within the D&amp;D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic
                                    is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.</p>
                                <p>Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it
                                    the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful
                                    archmage can’t light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or
                                    even reverse death itself.</p>
                                <p>All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called <b>arcane magic</b>. These spells rely on an understanding—learned
                                    or intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids,
                                    paladins, and rangers are called <b>divine magic</b>. These spellcasters’ access to the Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.</p>
                                <p>Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When characters use divination spells such as <a class="spell" href="#detect-magic">detect magic</a>                                    or <a class="spell" href="#identify">identify</a>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as <a class="spell" href="#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>                                    smooths the Weave. Spells such as <a class="spell" href="#antimagic-field">antimagic field</a> rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than
                                    through, the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways—or not at all.</p>

The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.</p>

                                                <p><dfn>Approach.</dfn> The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Drop.</dfn> The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Flee.</dfn> The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Grovel.</dfn> The target falls prone and then ends its turn.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Halt.</dfn> The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>At Higher Levels.</dfn> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p>

When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
                                                <p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
                                                <p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble that weapon.</p>

Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.</p>
                                                <p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration.

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).</p>
                                                <p>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>
                                                <p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span>. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>

The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.</p>
                                                <p>Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.</p>

                                                <p>You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>
                                                <p>While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>
                                                <p>You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.</p>
                                                <p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.</p>

When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>

                                                <p>This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.</p>
                                                <p>If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.</p>
                                                <p>You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>
                                                <p>If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p>

                                                <p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</p>
                                                <p>If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>
                                                <p>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p>
                                                <p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</p>
                                                <p>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has <span class="tooltip">AC<span class="tooltiptext">Armor Class</span></span> 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.</p>
                                                <p>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</p>

If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</p>
                                                <p>This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>At Higher Levels.</dfn> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.</p>

                                                <p><dfn>Familiarity.</dfn> “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.</p>
                                                <p>“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.</p>
                                                <p>“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>On Target.</dfn> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Off Target.</dfn> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10. 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Similar Area.</dfn> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Mishap.</dfn> The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>

                                                <p>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p>
                                                <p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Targeted Effects.</dfn> Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Areas of Magic.</dfn> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <a class="spell " href="#wall-of-fire">wall of fire</a> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Spells.</dfn> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Magic Items.</dfn> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a <i class="item">+1 longsword</i> in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>
                                                <p>A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Magical Travel.</dfn> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Creatures and Objects.</dfn> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Dispel Magic.</dfn> Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t nullify each other.</p>

                                                <p>You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>
                                                <p>While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>
                                                <p>You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.</p>
                                                <p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.</p>

                                                <p>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</p>
                                                <p>The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.</p>
                                                <p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p>
                                                <p>This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Fissures.</dfn> Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10. 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.</p>
                                                <p>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Structures.</dfn> The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the <span class="tooltip">DC<span class="tooltiptext">Difficulty Class</span></span> higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.</p>

                                                <p>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.</p>
                                                <p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.</p>
                                                <p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</p>
                                                <p>The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p>
                                                <p>The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p>
                                                <p>If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p>

                                                <p>When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.</p>

                                                <p>You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.</p>
                                                <p>When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Burial.</dfn> The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.</p>
                                                <p>The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Chaining.</dfn> Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then.</p>
                                                <p>The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Hedged Prison.</dfn> The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.</p>
                                                <p>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Minimus Containment.</dfn> The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.</p>
                                                <p>The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Slumber.</dfn> The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.</p>
                                                <p><dfn>Ending the Spell.</dfn> During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.</p>
                                                <p>A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p>
                                                <p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.</p>

                                       <p>Religion is an important part of life in the worlds of the D&amp;D multiverse. When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it’s hard to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence.</p>
                                       <p>Many people in the worlds of D&amp;D worship different gods at different times and circumstances. People in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest or champion of that god’s ideals.</p>
                                       <p>Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity for your character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental note of the gods who are revered in your DM’s campaign so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you’re playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested domains when selecting your character’s domain.</p>
                                       <h5 id="dnd-pantheons">D&amp;D Pantheons</h5>
                                       <p>Each world in the D&amp;D multiverse has its own pantheons of deities. This appendix deals with one pantheon, that of the Forgotten Realms.</p>
                                       <h6 id="forgotten-realms-pantheons">The Forgotten Realms</h6>
                                       <p>Dozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and many more are worshiped locally, by individual tribes, small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.</p>
                                       <h6 id="nonhuman-deities">Nonhuman Deities</h6>
                                       <p>Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races are revered on many different worlds, though not always in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk share these deities.</p>
                                       <p>Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf gods include Moradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and a number of other gods thought to be their children and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, Marthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdoms of dwarves might revere some, all, or none of these deities, and some have other gods unknown (or known by other names) to outsiders.</p>

                                          <p>Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, particularly if they are closely associated with healing, protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.</p>
                                          <p>A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your Dungeon Master.</p>

                                       <p>Many characters created in the Forgotten Realms setting, especially those for organized D&amp;D play, belong to one of five factions that have risen to prominence in the Realms. Each faction has its own motivations, goals, and philosophy. Some are more heroic than others, but all band together in times of trouble to thwart major threats.</p>
                                       <h5 id="harpers">Harpers</h5>
                                       <p><img alt=" " src="./files/faction_banner_harpers.svg " style="width:35%; float:right"></p>
                                       <p>This clandestine network of spellcasters and spies seeks to tip the scales in favor of the innocent, the weak, and the poor within the Realms. Harper agents pride themselves on being incorruptible defenders of good, and they never hesitate to aid the oppressed. Because they prefer to work behind the scenes, they are rarely noticed as they thwart tyrants, depose rulers, and head off any growing force that is rumored to have evil intent. The Harpers has its finger on the pulse of power in the Realms and works tirelessly to even the odds for the downtrodden.</p>
                                       <p>Individual Harper agents operate alone, relying on their wits and extensive information networks to gain an advantage over their enemies. They know that knowledge is power, so gathering intelligence beforehand is paramount to their success. They are well-informed and always have access to aid, magical and otherwise. Veteran members have access to secret caches of knowledge stashed all over Faerûn, along with trusted sources stationed in every major town and city.</p>
                                       <p>The organization is always on the lookout for powerful items, expressly to keep them out of the hands of evildoers. To this end its agents use various guises and identities to gain access to carefully guarded secrets such as ancestral maps, buried cities, and mages’ keeps.</p>
                                       <p>The bond between Harpers is strong, and their friendships are nigh unbreakable. Rarely do they operate in the open, but on rare occasions they must, because there is no other choice. When that happens, you can be sure that a fellow Harper is watching closely, ready to emerge from the shadows and help a comrade at a moment’s notice.</p>
                                       <blockquote>
                                          <p>“A Harper is first and foremost self-reliant, for once you are autonomous then no one can tempt you into using power as a crutch. You are sovereign unto yourself.</p>
                                          <p>“Therefore, a Harper’s soul must be incorruptible. Many believe themselves to be so, but power comes in many guises, and it will surely find your weakness. Of this you may be certain. Only a true Harper can pass this test and transform weakness into strength. That is why we are the hand that stops the tyrant, feeds the oppressed, and asks for nothing in return.</p>
                                          <p>“We are the song for those who have no voice.”</p>

                                       <h5 id="order-of-the-gauntlet">Order of the Gauntlet</h5>
                                       <p><img alt=" " src="./files/faction_banner_order-of-the-gauntlet.svg " style="width:35%; float:right"></p>
                                       <p>The Order of the Gauntlet is a relatively new organization dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks and without hesitation. The Order understands that evil wears many guises, playing games and tricking others in order to spread. That is why its members act on their own authority, identifying threats and smashing them before they can grow.</p>
                                       <p>Because the seeds of evil are nourished in the shadows, the Order of the Gauntlet rides out to the most dangerous dungeons, the darkest caverns, and the foulest pits to weed out wrongdoers. But the Order is keenly aware that the shadow of evil lies within everyone, waiting for a moment when it can gain a foothold on their souls. Thus its paladins, monks, and clerics spend long hours deep in prayer to keep their inner eye vigilant and focused on their own thoughts and emotions. In this way they purify themselves from within before taking up their swords to cleanse the world.</p>
                                       <p>The Order of the Gauntlet believes that all sentient beings must come to the light of reason and goodness of their own volition. That is why it is not interested in controlling minds: it focuses only on deeds, setting an example to the world in hopes of inspiring and enlightening others. The Order holds that faith in one’s god, one’s friends, and one’s self are the greatest weapons in quelling the hordes of malice.</p>
                                       <p>With such devout conviction, the Order’s members can be depended on as a source of strength to themselves and others, a bright light against the darkness. They are not preemptive bullies, though. A strict code of honor allows them to strike only when evil deeds are being committed. Thus, the Order of the Gauntlet is hypervigilant, using every resource at their disposal—both divine and mundane—to know where and when dark deeds will occur.</p>
                                       <blockquote>
                                          <p>“That’s the thing about evil: it is darkness, it is shadow, it hides in your blind spot. Then, when you are distracted, it sneaks in. Evil is a master of disguise—and what is the greatest disguise, you ask? Yourself. Evil will cloak itself in thoughts and emotions pretending to be your own, telling you to get angry, to be greedy and envious, to hold yourself above others.</p>
                                          <p>“People aren’t born evil—it takes time for evil to fool you into thinking that its voice is yours. That is why to know who you truly are is what the Order requires from each hopeful who wishes to join our ranks. Bravery isn’t fighting the dragon out there—it is fighting the dragon within. That is what we do in our prayers. Once you have slain that dragon, you have overcome the darkness lurking within yourself. Only then do you have the capacity to know true goodness. Only then are you ready to take up the sword and wear the badge of our Order.”</p>

                                       <p>The Emerald Enclave is a far-ranging group that opposes threats to the natural world and helps others survive in the wilderness. Branches of the organization are scattered throughout Faerûn and often operate in isolation from the others. This existence teaches the Enclave’s members a fierce self-reliance and mastery of certain fighting and survival skills.</p>
                                       <p>A ranger of the Enclave might be hired to lead a caravan through a treacherous mountain pass or the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale. A druid might volunteer to help a village prepare for a long, brutal winter. Barbarians and druids who live as hermits might appear from nowhere to help defend a town against marauding orcs.</p>
                                       <p>Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive and, more importantly, to help others do the same. They are not opposed to civilization or progress, but they strive to keep it in balance with the wild. They restore and preserve the natural order, even as they root out and destroy all that is unnatural. They keep the elemental forces of the world in check and keep civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.</p>
                                       <blockquote>
                                          <p>“The Emerald Enclave exists as gatekeepers to that vast space beyond the city walls. We are the defenders of the wilderness and of the society that does not understand it. Most have forgotten that there is an ancient, natural order that existed long before our intellectual concepts of it. To come into contact with that primal order is to touch the power that guides all of life.</p>
                                          <p>“Those who walk the way of the Emerald Enclave are infused with this power; we embody it, and it moves us to do our work. That is why we are never alone. Even in the midst of a noisy, crowded city we can feel the presence of the natural world inside us, fresh, strong, and alive. The Enclave seeks to make awareness of this power available to all.</p>
                                          <p>“Freedom. Is not this the highest of callings?”</p>

                                       <p>The Lords’ Alliance is an association of rulers from cities and towns across Faerûn (primarily in the North), who believe that solidarity is needed to keep evil at bay. The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Neverwinter, and other free cities dominate the coalition, and all lords in the Alliance work primarily for the fate and fortune of their individual settlements.</p>
                                       <p>Alliance agents include sophisticated bards, zealous paladins, talented mages, and grizzled warriors. They are chosen primarily for their loyalty and are experts in observation, stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy and the privileged, they carry fine equipment (often disguised to appear common), including large numbers of scrolls scribed with spells of communication.</p>
                                       <p>Agents of the Lords’ Alliance ensure the safety and prosperity of civilized Faerûn by standing united against the forces that threaten civilization. They proactively eliminate such threats by any means, fighting with pride for the glory and security of their people, and for the lords who rule over them. However, Alliance operatives are often glory hounds, looking to gain a leg up on their counterparts from other Alliance cities. The leaders of the Alliance know that the order will survive only if its members support each other, requiring a balance between pride and diplomacy. Rogue agents within the Lords’ Alliance are rare, but defections have been known to occur.</p>
                                       <blockquote>
                                          <p>“Everyone wants to sleep at night and feel safe in their homes, but how many want to do what it takes to keep the tide of evil at bay? To stand in the cold and rain, waiting for battle while hunger gnaws at their bellies? Many wish to reap the rewards of a good harvest, but few care to remove the stones and till the fields for planting.</p>
                                          <p>“The Lords’ Alliance fights the things that the shopkeeper in his bed has never even heard of. We remove threats before the town mayor even knows about it. We make bad things go away. That’s what we’re good at.”</p>

                                       <p>The Zhentarim, or Black Network, is an organization of well-trained mercenaries, savvy rogues, and crafty warlocks who seek to expand their influence and power throughout Faerûn. Agents of the Zhentarim feel that if they play by the rules, nothing gets done. Ultimately, they want to make the rules—and, in some cases, they already do. They walk a fine line when it comes to the letter of the law and don’t shy away from the occasional shady deal or illicit activity to get what they want.</p>
                                       <p>To the Zhentarim, wealth is power. Its agents know that nothing else inspires such confidence and dispels doubt so well. In an instant, wealth speaks louder than a thousand bards. Zhentarim agents routinely carry the finest weapons and armor, with no expense spared. When a merchant needs an escort for a caravan, when a noble family requires bodyguards to protect its holdings, or when a city is desperate for trained soldiers to defend its walls, the Zhentarim provides the best warriors money can buy.</p>
                                       <p>The organization encourages individual ambition and rewards innovators who take matters into their own hands. Results are all that matter. Those who come into the Black Network with nothing can become major players within the organization through their own moxie and hard work.</p>
                                       <blockquote>
                                          <p>“Membership in the Zhentarim is like a key to a thousand doors, each one a gateway to fulfilling a personal desire. Most people shy away from this kind of freedom. They like their restraints, laws, and swaddling—it gives them the illusion of security.</p>
                                          <p>“The Black Network provides what I need to explore realms and dimensions that would tear apart minds accustomed to limits. Only in such places can I find magic powerful enough to defeat beings that know no such thing as time, fear, or mercy. You might not like the Zhentarim’s methods, but when a demon crawls out of the Abyss and comes for your family, you’ll be glad that I have gone to the darkest of realms to find the answer to your problem.”</p>
