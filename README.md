### How to help
Any help is welcome, this project is in a early stage.
For legal reasons we can't add more info from the others books like [Player's Handbook](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook) or any other source with copyright. Anyway we can create new content to fix erratas, improve examples or add a solo adventure for example.
The current version has a lack of images, which can be added with the property copyright, as well other content.
